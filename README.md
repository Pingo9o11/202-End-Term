#Image Steganalysis and Retrieval Integrity Research Project

#Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive research project exploring the intricate relationship between steganography, steganalysis, and image retrieval integrity. Our research focuses on developing and analyzing methods to detect hidden information within digital images using advanced statistical techniques.
Project Background
The research emerges from a critical investigation into Information Organization and Retrieval (IOR), specifically addressing the challenges of maintaining data integrity in digital image environments. By employing sophisticated steganalysis techniques, we aim to uncover potential hidden data manipulations that could compromise image retrieval systems.

#Key Research Objectives

Investigate Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography techniques
Develop statistical methods for detecting hidden information
Analyze the impact of steganographic interventions on image integrity
Explore the implications for information retrieval systems

#Methodology
Experimental Approach

  1. Implemented LSB steganography on 10 diverse image types
  2. Utilized chi-squared statistical analysis for detection
  3. Conducted comprehensive statistical testing with p-value analysis

#Key Techniques

  1. Least Significant Bit (LSB) manipulation
  2. Chi-squared statistical testing
  3. Image integrity assessment

#Repository Contents

1. Sample images used in the research
2. Source code for steganography and steganalysis
3. README.md: Project overview and instructions

Research Paper
A pilot research paper documenting the methodology, experimental results, and findings is included in the repo. The paper follows standard academic research format and provides in-depth analysis of our investigation.
